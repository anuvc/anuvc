### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm dedicated to studying life and intelligence from first principles with the goal of creating artificial life and intelligence. I hold the belief that these are intrinsic properties of the universe that can be replicated with the right informational configuration.

Previously, I developed transformer models for IBM RXN for Chemistry, the first remotely accessible, autonomous chemical laboratory. Additionally, I contributed to pyamiimage, software for extracting chemical reactivity from chemical pathway diagrams in scientific literature.

Keen on collaborations and discussions in these domains.
