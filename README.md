### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an explorer in physics, artificial intelligence, and life, studying them from first principles. I believe that life and intelligence are scale-free properties of the universe.

Previously, I developed transformer models for IBM RXN for Chemistry, the first remotely accessible, autonomous chemical laboratory. Additionally, I contributed to pyamiimage, software for extracting chemical reactivity from chemical pathway diagrams in scientific literature.

Keen on collaborations and discussions in these domains.
